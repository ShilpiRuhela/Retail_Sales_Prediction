# Retail_Sales_prediction
hello, I will use regression techniques to predict sales forecast and make a better machine learning model.



**Data Discription & Task:**

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied. My work includes various plots and graphs , visualizations , feature engineering , ensemble techniques , different ML algorithms with their respective parameter tuning , analysis and trends . Predictions are of 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany.

The work here forecasts the sales of the various Rossmann stores across Europe for the recent six weeks and compares the results from the models developed with the actual sales values.

The dataset consists of two csv files: rossmann store data.csv and store.csv

Data Files:

store.csv holds info about each store. rossmann store data.csv holds the sales info per day for each store.
